# 2021

This year, I've been tinkering a lot with [Deno][deno] as a [TypeScript][ts]
runtime and have been really enjoying it. I'm hoping to write this year's AoC
solutions using it.

Specifically, here's my `deno --version` output:

    deno 1.16.3 (release, x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu)
    v8 9.7.106.5
    typescript 4.4.2

Enjoy!
